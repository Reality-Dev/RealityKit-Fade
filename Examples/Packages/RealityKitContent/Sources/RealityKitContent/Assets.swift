/// removed from the SwiftUI view hierarchy while the initializer's load
/// operation is in progress. In that case, the method returns `nil`.
/// Upon receiving a `nil` return value, callers typically bypass any
/// further entity configuration, because the system discards the entity.
///
/// - Parameter name: The name of the entity to load from the bundle.
/// - Returns: The entity from the bundle, or `nil` if the system cancels
///   the load operation before it completes. The method aborts the app
///   for any other kind of load failure.
